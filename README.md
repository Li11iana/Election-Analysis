## Election Audit Summary

The code simplifies the election analysis and its adequate for variable input since it can adapt to data sources with different counties and candidates, extracting this information and using it to elaborate the summaries so the code can be resuse with minimal to no refactoring.
An additional improvement that could be added could be more checking points for the analyst by printing the list and dictionaries used in order to confirm that all the information is being properly assessed.
