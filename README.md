## Election Audit Summary

The Python script simplifies the election analysis and is adaptable for variable input. It automatically iterates through data sources with different counties and candidates, extracting information to generate summaries. The code can be reused with minimal to no refactoring for datasets with a similar format. For improved usability, additional checking points for the analyst can be configured by printing lists and dictionaries used to confirm proper information assessment.

- Reccomendations:

Adding more checkpoints by printing lists and dictionaries would facilitate following the analysis, ensuring auditing of critical information and possibly spotting errors given the sensitivity of the information.
